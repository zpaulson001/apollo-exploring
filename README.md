# Apollo Exploring 👨‍🚀

This is a simple project to explore the inner workings of Apollo Server. Currently, it's just a server that can fetch data about Trainers and their Pokémon. The data for trainers is stored in db.ts while the data for Pokémon is fetched from the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).
